Video Game Sales Practice Case Study
Citation: Gregory Smith. (2022). Video Games Sales [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5898311


This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com. 


Platform Key: 2600 - Atari 2600           GB - Game Boy   GBA - Game Boy Advance   GC - GameCube
                        GEN - Sega Genesis        N64 - Nintendo   NES - Nintendo Entertainment System         
           PS - PlayStation        PS2 - PlayStation 2  PS3  - PlayStation 3     PS4 - PlayStation 4
           PSP - PlayStation Portable        SNES - Super Nintendo Entertainment System
            X360 - XBox 360        XB - XBox        XOne - XBox One
           
Main Areas/ Continents: na - North America         eu - Europe        jp - Japan


Sales - Sales are per 100,000
ex: 1 sale  = 100,000 sales OR .5 sale = 50,000 sales


Stats:
* Data spans 1980 to 2016 (36 years)
* 17 total genres
* 500 games


Cleaning Steps:


1. Reduced the data to the top 500 ranked games
2. Reviewed for missing/incomplete data and filled it in 
   1. Genre, Year
      1. Friend Collection is actually Tomodachi Collection 
3. Standardized formatting to be uniform
   1. i.e. Operating System 2600 is not a number it is text


Limitations:
* This dataset does include all country sales and instead groups them as “other_sales”, making it difficult to verify the validity of the sales
* I limited the the dataset to the top 500 sales, which limited the year range to 2016

SQL Data Results




1. Which area consumes/ buys the most video games?
I used the SUM function to look at the total sales for each listed region, instead of identifying the top consumer of video games. I rounded the total_na_sales as it was a trailing float. 
SELECT  
  ROUND(SUM(na_sales),2) AS total_na_sales,
  SUM(eu_sales) AS total_eu_sales,
  SUM(jp_sales) AS total_jp_sales
FROM 
  `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales`;


  



Answer: North America bought the most video games total




2. What are the 5 most popular genres in each listed region (North America, Europe, Japan)?
I used the SUM and GROUP BY functions on each regions sales to find the total sales for each genre listed  


North America
SELECT  
  Genre,
  ROUND(SUM(na_sales),2) AS na_genre_sales,
FROM
  `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales`
GROUP BY 
  Genre
ORDER BY 
  na_genre_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
  



Europe
SELECT  
  Genre,
  ROUND(SUM(eu_sales),2) AS eu_genre_sales,
FROM
  `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales`
GROUP BY 
  Genre
ORDER BY 
  eu_genre_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
  







Japan
SELECT  
  Genre,
  ROUND(SUM(jp_sales),2) AS jp_genre_sales,
FROM
  `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales`
GROUP BY 
  Genre
ORDER BY 
  jp_genre_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;

1. Shooter                Action                Role-Playing
2. Action                Sports                        Platform
3. Platform                 Shooter                Action
4. Sports                        Platform                Racing
5. Role-Playing                Role-Playing                Sports




3. What is the most popular game in North America, Europe and Japan by sales?        
I created a subquery to find the name of the most popular game. 


North America
SELECT 
  Name,
  na_sales
FROM 
  `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales` 
WHERE 
  na_sales IN (
    SELECT MAX(na_sales)
    FROM `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales`
  );
  



Europe
SELECT 
  Name,
  eu_sales
FROM 
  `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales` 
WHERE 
  eu_sales IN (
    SELECT MAX(eu_sales)
    FROM `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales`
  );
  



Japan
SELECT 
  Name,
  jp_sales
FROM 
  `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales` 
WHERE 
  jp_sales IN (
    SELECT MAX(jp_sales)
    FROM `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales`
  );
  



Answer:
North America: Wii Sports
Europe: Wii Sports
Japan: Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue




4. What is the most popular game by sales?
This is a variation of the subquery from question 3. The included column global sales is the sum of all 4 regions (North America, Europe, Japan, and Other). All that was left was to isolate the name of the most and least popular games. 


        Most Popular
SELECT 
  Name,
  global_sales
FROM 
  `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales` 
WHERE 
  global_sales IN (
    SELECT MAX (global_sales)
    FROM `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales`
  );
  



Least Popular
SELECT 
  Name,
  global_sales
FROM 
  `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales` 
WHERE 
  global_sales IN (
    SELECT MIN (global_sales)
    FROM `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales`
  );
  



Answer:
Most Popular:                                 Least Popular:
Wii Sports                                        Need for Speed: Most Wanted
                                                Hot Shots Golf 3


5. What are the top 5 consoles?
SELECT 
  Platform,
FROM 
  `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales` 
GROUP BY
  Platform
ORDER BY
  SUM(global_sales) DESC
LIMIT 5;
  









6. Which console produced the most sales?
SELECT 
  Platform,
  ROUND(SUM(global_sales),2) as total_sales
FROM 
  `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales` 
GROUP BY
  Platform
ORDER BY
  total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
  

Answer: Wii with 44,446,000 sales


7. Total video game sales per year?
SELECT 
  Year,
  ROUND(SUM(global_sales),2) AS total_sales
FROM 
  `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales`
GROUP BY
  YEAR
ORDER BY
  Year;
  
  







8. How many video games were sold per genre? 
SELECT 
  Genre,
  COUNT(Name) AS num_sold
FROM 
  `portfolio-projects-365917.sql_case_studies.video_game_sales`
GROUP BY
  Genre
ORDER BY
  num_sold;
